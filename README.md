# Project

To run the program, use the "run program" script if you're on Linux or the "run program windows" script if you are on Windows, there is also the option to use the "runProgram(no compile" scripts if you have already compiled the code previously. 

If the regular "runProgram" script is ran it will compile the program and launch Program.class. From here you can choose to use the text-version of the GUI-version or test code. Contextual information on the tests will only appear if the tests fail. If all tests pass for a specific class a message will print to the console saying "All Tests for <classname> passed".
