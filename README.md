# Project

To run the program, use the "run program" script if you're on Linux or the "run program windows" script if you are on Windows. From here it will compile the program and launch Program.class. From here you can choose to use the text-version of the GUI-version. 

To run the test code, call the individual methods or our script to use the tests in the main methods of the classes. Databas's test does not currently work.
