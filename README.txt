The class diagram should also be included in the zip file. If not, it will be on GitHub.

To compile and run the program, use the "runProgram" script if you're on Linux or the "runProgram windows" script if you are on Windows. there is also the option to use the 
"runProgram(no compile)" script if you have already compiled the code previously (for windows). If the regular "runProgram" script is ran it will compile the program and launch Program.class. 
From here you can choose to use the text-version of the GUI-version or test code. Contextual information on the tests will only appear if the tests fail. If all tests pass for 
a specific class a message will print to the console saying "All Tests for <classname> passed".
